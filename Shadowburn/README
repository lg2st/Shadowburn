{Myrostic reports:
In here I will post my reports and what I have beed doing/changing during my GM time.
Anything that I add/remove/modify will be here and there will also be other posts like this.
On these post you will see what I've been doing or what I've been working on. 
For Example: If I find any NPC that doesn't exist or that can't be reached 
(wrong faction, phase or whatever) I will post it here with the GUID, ENTRY, gps and other stuff that 
have been modified.
Also I will add/post detailed reports on the events I've created on the separate places.
In those reports I will include GUID numbers, ENTRY numbers along with the gps of the objects I've added.
I hope that this will be usefull for you guys to "keep an eye on my activities" and to follow my actions.
I decided to make it this way because now all of you can track it without forwarding messages. 

If there is anything you think I should add/change please feel free to contact me via info I left on the site.

Thank You for your time. }
